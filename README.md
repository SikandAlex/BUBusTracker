# Boston University BusTracker
iOS application that allows users to view Boston University bus locations and schedules.

Unfortunately no screen shots because Boston University bus service has been suspended due to COVID-19. 

I'm hoping that other student's might find this repository and contribute to it. I have implemented the Codable property to make decoding from the live bus JSON response easy in Swift!

## Installation

You must be using a Mac with Xcode installed. 

1) Clone the repo 
2) Run 'pod install' in the project directory to install CocoaPod dependencies 
3) Open BUBusTracker.xcworkspace

Build and run the app on the iOS simulator or connect your iPhone and install directly to your physical device.
